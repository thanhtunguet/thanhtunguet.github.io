# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pham Thanh Tung â€” Engineer | Builder | Startup Co-founder

Iâ€™m a full-stack product engineer with a strong foundation in system architecture, DevOps, and cross-platform mobile development. Over the past years, Iâ€™ve helped build scalable, real-world systems â€” from anonymous chatbots to government-grade procurement system, IoT solutions â€” and recently, I'm exploring how Generative AI can supercharge product delivery in early-stage startups.

Iâ€™m currently a co-founder and tech lead at a startup in Hanoi, where I combine **technical leadership**, **team mentoring**, and **hands-on development** to bring products from zero to one.
