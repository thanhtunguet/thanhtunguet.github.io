Thank you for using my tools and applications. Your privacy is important, and I am committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines how my applications and services handle user data.

### **1. Data Collection**
I do not collect, store, or share any personal data, usage information, or any other user-related data. My applications and tools are designed solely to enhance productivity and efficiency without tracking or storing user information.

Since no data is collected, there is no data usage, processing, or sharing with third parties. All operations occur locally on the user's device or as per the intended functionality of the tool.

### **3. Permissions**
Some of my applications may request certain permissions (e.g., storage access, clipboard access, browser extension permissions). These permissions are strictly used to provide the intended functionality and are not used to collect or transmit any data.

### **4. Third-Party Services**
My applications do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Any third-party services used (e.g., APIs for functionality) operate within their respective privacy policies and do not involve data collection from my end.

### **5. Security**
While I do not collect any data, I ensure that my applications follow best security practices to protect user privacy. Users are encouraged to update to the latest versions to benefit from security enhancements.

### **6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Users are encouraged to review this page periodically.
