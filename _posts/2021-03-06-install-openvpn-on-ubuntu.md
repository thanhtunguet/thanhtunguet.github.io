# Install OpenVPN on Ubuntu: A Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a secure VPN is essential for protecting sensitive data and enabling remote access. OpenVPN, an open-source VPN solution, is a popular choice for its flexibility and strong security features. This guide simplifies the setup process using a community-maintained script.

## Why Choose OpenVPN?

OpenVPN is widely used for:

- Secure remote access.
- Site-to-site VPNs.
- Protecting data with robust encryption protocols.

While its flexibility is a strength, the manual setup process can be complex. Fortunately, a community-maintained script automates the installation and configuration, making it accessible even for beginners.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A server running Ubuntu.
- Root or sudo access to the server.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Download the OpenVPN Installation Script

Use the following command to download the script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable

Grant execute permissions to the script:

```bash
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script with superuser privileges:

```bash
sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
```

The script will guide you through the setup process, including selecting the protocol, port, and DNS provider. Once completed, it will generate a client configuration file for connecting to your VPN server.

> **Note:** This script is maintained by [Nyr](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install). You can find the source code and additional details in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install).

## Automating Connection Monitoring

To ensure your VPN connection remains active, you can set up a cron job to monitor and reconnect if necessary.

### 1. Create a Monitoring Script

Write a script to check the connection:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if ! ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 &> /dev/null; then
  systemctl restart openvpn
fi
```

Save this script as `vpn-monitor.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x vpn-monitor.sh
```

### 2. Schedule the Script with Cron

Add the script to your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run the script every 5 minutes:

```bash
*/5 * * * * /path/to/vpn-monitor.sh
```

## Conclusion

By using the community-maintained script, you can set up OpenVPN on Ubuntu quickly and efficiently. Automating connection monitoring ensures a reliable VPN experience, making this guide a valuable resource for developers and network administrators.
