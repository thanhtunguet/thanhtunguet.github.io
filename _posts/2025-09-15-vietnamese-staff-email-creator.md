Managing employee email addresses can be time-consuming for HR teams—especially when working with Vietnamese names, which come with unique linguistic characteristics. Today, I’m happy to introduce **Vietnamese Staff Email Creator** — a specialized web app that automates the process of generating standardized email addresses from Vietnamese staff names.

## Real-world challenges

Vietnamese names present a few distinctive challenges when generating email usernames:

- **Complex diacritics**: Names contain tone marks (á, à, ả, ã, ạ, etc.) that must be handled correctly
- **Name structure**: Vietnamese naming conventions differ from Western ones
- **Consistency requirements**: Organizations need a standardized format
- **Manual work**: Converting Excel files by hand takes time and is error-prone

## A smart solution

Vietnamese Staff Email Creator solves these challenges with an automated approach that understands Vietnamese naming conventions.

### How it works

The app follows a systematic process to convert Vietnamese names into email usernames:

**1. Identify the naming pattern**
Vietnamese names are processed using the pattern: `Given name + initials`

**Examples:**
- Phạm Thanh Tùng → TungPT
- Trần Thanh Thảo → ThaoTT  
- Lê Minh Thành → ThanhLM

**2. Smart processing pipeline**
- **Remove diacritics**: Automatically strips Vietnamese tone marks
- **Reorder the name**: Moves the given name to the front, followed by initials
- **Handle duplicates**: Appends an incremental number for collisions
- **Add the domain**: Combines the username with your company domain

**3. Intelligent duplicate handling**
When a duplicate username is detected:
- First person: Trần Phương Thảo → ThaoTP → thaotp@congty.com
- Second person: Tạ Phương Thảo → ThaoTP1 → thaotp1@congty.com
