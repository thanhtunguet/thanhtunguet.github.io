## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Static Blog Using Jekyll and Chirpy Theme

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Markdown and Git
- Installed Ruby and Jekyll on your machine
- GitHub account

### Step 1: Install Jekyll

First, ensure you have Ruby installed. Then, install Jekyll and Bundler:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Step 2: Create a New Jekyll Site

Create a new Jekyll site with the following command:

```bash
jekyll new my-blog
cd my-blog
```

### Step 3: Add Chirpy Theme

Clone the Chirpy theme repository into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy.git
```

Copy the necessary files from the Chirpy theme directory to your Jekyll site directory. Ensure your directory structure integrates the theme correctly.

### Step 4: Configure Your Site

Open the `_config.yml` file and adjust the settings according to your preferences. Ensure you set the theme to `chirpy`.

```yaml
theme: chirpy
title: My Technical Blog
description: >
  A blog documenting my technical journey.
```

### Step 5: Build and Serve Locally

Run the following command to build and serve your site locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` to see your blog in action.

### Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your local Jekyll site to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings -> Pages, and set the source to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site.
