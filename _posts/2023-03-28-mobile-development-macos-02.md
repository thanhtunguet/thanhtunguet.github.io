## Installing Xcode

### What is Xcode?

Xcode is Apple's official IDE for developing applications on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It includes tools for coding, debugging, version control, UI design, and testing. Xcode supports programming languages like Swift, Objective-C, and C++.

### How to Install Xcode

1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac.
2. Search for **Xcode**.
3. Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.

### Installing CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for iOS and macOS projects. It simplifies adding, updating, and managing libraries.

To install CocoaPods, use one of the following commands:

```bash
brew install cocoapods
```

or

```bash
gem install cocoapods
```

**Note**: If using `gem`, consider installing `rbenv` or `rvm` to manage Ruby environments and avoid conflicts with macOS's default Ruby.

### DevCleaner for Xcode

Install **DevCleaner for Xcode** from the App Store to clean up cache and derived data generated by Xcode. This is especially useful for React Native projects, as the cache can grow significantly.

## Rosetta and Chip Architecture Issues

### What is Rosetta?

Rosetta is a macOS tool that allows applications designed for Intel architecture to run on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs. While not as fast as native apps, it ensures compatibility with older software.

### When to Use Rosetta?

By default, Xcode and Terminal support the latest chip architecture. However, if you're working on older projects or dependencies (e.g., `node-sass` v4 or v5), you may need to enable Rosetta.

#### How to Enable Rosetta for Xcode

1. Open the **Applications** folder.
2. Right-click on **Xcode** and select **Get Info**.
3. Check the box for **Open using Rosetta**.
4. Restart Xcode.

## Installing Java

For Android development, Java 11 is the most stable version. Avoid installing multiple Java versions unless necessary.

### Recommended Java Version: Azul JDK

Azul JDK is a free, easy-to-install Java distribution. Download it from [Azul's website](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#zulu).

After installation, set Java 11 as the default by adding the following line to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"
```

## Installing Android Studio

### What is Android Studio?

Android Studio is Google's official IDE for Android development. It includes tools for coding, debugging, UI design, and APK building.

### How to Install Android Studio

1. Visit [Android Studio's official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Download the version matching your Mac's chip architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon).
3. Install and launch Android Studio.

### Configuring the Android Environment

1. Open Android Studio and complete the initial setup.
2. Go to **SDK Manager** (accessible via the three-dot menu next to "New Project").
3. Configure the following:

#### Android Platform Tools

Select the Android versions you need (e.g., the latest version or older ones for legacy projects).

#### Android SDK Tools

Enable **Android SDK Command Line Tools**. This is mandatory for Flutter development.

### Setting Environment Variables

Add the following lines to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Android
export ANDROID_HOME="${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk"
export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools"
export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/cmdline-tools"
export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools"
export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools/bin"
```

Verify the setup by running:

```bash
which adb
which sdkmanager
```

## Installing Flutter

### Download Flutter SDK

1. Visit [Flutter's installation page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos).
2. Download the SDK for your Mac's architecture.
3. Extract the SDK to a directory (e.g., `/opt/flutter`).

### Configure Flutter Environment

Add the following lines to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Flutter
export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/flutter/bin"
export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin"
```

### Install Chrome for Debugging

Flutter uses Chrome for debugging web apps. Install Google Chrome or another Chromium-based browser. If using a non-default browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge), specify its path in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export CHROME_EXECUTABLE="/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge"
```
